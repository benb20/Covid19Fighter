# Covid-19 Fighter

Covid-19 Fighter is a 2D side-scroller game developed in Unity where players control a robot fighting against COVID-19 viruses. The game features a robot character that can move, jump, shoot, and interact with various game elements.

## Gameplay

- Move: Use the horizontal arrow keys or A/D keys to move the robot left or right.
- Jump: Press the Space key to make the robot jump.
- Shoot: Press the left mouse button or the Fire1 button to shoot projectiles at the enemies.
- Power-ups: Collect batteries to temporarily increase the robot's movement speed.
- Upgrades: The robot can gain permanent upgrades via the in-game shop.
- Health: The robot has a health bar that decreases when hit by enemies. If the health reaches zero, the game ends.

## Scripts

The game includes several scripts that control different aspects of the gameplay. Here are some examples:

- **RobotPlayer.cs**: This script manages the player's movement, shooting, health, and interactions with the game environment. It handles inputs from the player and updates the robot's position, animations, and shooting behavior.
- **HealthBar.cs**: This script displays and updates the robot's health bar UI.
- **Shot.cs**: This script controls the behavior of the robot's projectiles, including movement and collision detection.
